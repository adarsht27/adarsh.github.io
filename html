    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to my website! My name is Sebastian Ramirez Ruiz. I am a Doctoral Candidate and Research Associate at the Hertie School in Berlin. I hold a Master's of Public Policy and B.As in Sociology and Political Science. I am particularly interested in causal inference, opinion and preference formation, the use of research evidence in policy- and decision-making, #rstats, and most importantly, bicycles.
